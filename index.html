            <p>In order to keep the markup maintainable, I have used React as a template engine with which I generate the static HTML markup.</p>
            <p>Items are described in a <a href="items.js">JavaScript file</a> which is used to generate the static markup you see here. I wanted to show that modern web tooling such as Node and React can be used to build a website without forcing the users
                to have JavaScript enabled in order to use the site.</p>
            <p>In fact I inverted the JavaScript challenge of the midterm in on itself and challenged myself to use no JavaScript in the browser, but use as much as I wanted on the server side, for the asset build pipeline. I did this because so often these
                days we see sites that don&#x27;t degrade well and depend wholly on JavaScript in order to render at all. This project shows that, using React, we can have the best of both worlds.</p>
            <p>Thank you and please enjoy my portfolio.</p>
