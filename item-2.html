        This website is pretty cool, so I have included it here in my portfolio. The graphic design may not be so great but the technical statement it is making is important. Too many websites now require JavaScript and won't even render without it. This website
        uses JavaScript, heavily, but it will render exactly the same on a server with or without JavaScript enabled.
