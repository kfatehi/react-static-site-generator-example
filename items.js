  Critique is a mobile-first video collaboration software used
  by many productions. I developed the web interface, backend, and
  supported development of the mobile clients during my 3 years at
  <a href="http://www.digitalfilmtree.com">DigitalFilm Tree</a> from 2011 to 2015. The Critique 
  app can be found on the iOS App Store and at <a href="http://www.critiquecloud.com">CritiqueCloud.com</a>

  Crumple is a failed startup of mine in which we created an
  electronic receipt solution. It worked by intercepting the
  communication between a point of sale computer and a receipt
  printer. The customer then claimed the receipt "over the air"
  using a smartphone with our app installed -- or simply entered
  a phone number or email address. We developed all the hardware
  and software for the
  solution and even got it FCC certified. We had it deployed
  successfully in two different stores, but the sales "team"
  which was essentially just my partner, burned out and we
  closed up shop. A post-mortem is published at my blog, at this
  <a href="http://keyvanfatehi.com/2016/01/19/Crumple-a-post-mortem/">direct link</a>.

  This website is pretty cool, so I have included it here
  in my portfolio. The graphic design may not be so great
  but the technical statement it is making is important. Too
  many websites now require JavaScript and won't even render
  without it. This website uses JavaScript, heavily, but it
  will render exactly the same on a server with or without
  JavaScript enabled.
