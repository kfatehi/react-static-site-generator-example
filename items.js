  Crumple is a failed startup of mine in which we created an
  electronic receipt solution. It worked by intercepting the
  communication between a point of sale computer and a receipt
  printer. We developed all the hardware and software for the
  solution and even got it FCC certified. We had it deployed
  successfully in two different stores, but the sales "team"
  which was essentially just my partner, burned out and we
  closed up shop. A post-mortem is published at my blog, at this
  <a href="http://keyvanfatehi.com/2016/01/19/Crumple-a-post-mortem/">direct link</a>.
