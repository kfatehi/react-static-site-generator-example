        Crumple is a failed startup of mine in which we created an electronic receipt solution. It worked by intercepting the communication between a point of sale computer and a receipt printer. The customer then claimed the receipt "over the air" using a smartphone
        with our app installed -- or simply entered a phone number or email address. We developed all the hardware and software for the solution and even got it FCC certified. We had it deployed successfully in two different stores, but the sales "team"
        which was essentially just my partner, burned out and we closed up shop. A post-mortem is published at my blog, at this
        <a href="http://keyvanfatehi.com/2016/01/19/Crumple-a-post-mortem/">direct link</a>.
